# [WIP] My Personal Portfolio

Here's a preview of my personal portfolio (which is written in React). It's still currently work in progress, but I do try to sneak in a few coding hours from time to time. The idea is to have those interested in my profile walk around in my digital office (which was inspired by 'among us' and other top down games) where they can see my work history, projects, contact details, download a copy of my CV and as my personal stretch goal, to be able to have a live chat with other visitors (using WebRTC).
